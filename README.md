## Description
This repository holds two wordpress plugins.
SurveyPlugin: This is the main survey plugin that alows users to create, manage and answer surveys.
survey-filter-plugin: This plugin generates reports based on answers and survey questions.

## Prerequisits
These plugins make the bulk of the site. The WordPress site itself uses a blank theme, with minor changes and no styling. For the plug-ins to work, we need to create tables that the plug-ins use, I will reserve this space as a reminder to update the plugins to create the necessary tables on load.
There should be no other prerequisits.

## Installation
Before installing the plugins, the necessary tables need to be created, and a blank WordPress theme should be installed.
Once the above is completed, we can simply install the plugins SurveyPlugin and survey-filter-plugin.

## Usage
Reserved once documentation is complete.
